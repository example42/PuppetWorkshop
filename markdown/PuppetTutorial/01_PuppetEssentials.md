# What is Puppet

  A **Configuration Management** Tool

  A framework for **Systems Automation**

  A Declarative Domain Specific Language (**DSL**)

  An **OpenSource software** in written Ruby

  Works on Linux, Unix (Solaris, AIX, *BSD), MacOS, Windows ([Supported Platforms](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html))

  Developed by **[Puppet Labs](http://puppetlabs.com)**

  Used by [http://puppetlabs.com/customers/companies/](http://puppetlabs.com/customers/companies/) ...

  ... and **many** others


# Configuration Management advantages

  **Infrastructure as Code**: Track, Test, Deploy, Reproduce, Scale

  Code commits log shows the **history of change** on the infrastructure

  **Reproducible setups**: Do once, repeat forever

  **Scale** quickly: Done for one, use on many

  **Coherent** and consistent server setups

  **Aligned Environments** for devel, test, qa, prod nodes

# Puppet Versions

From version 2 Puppet follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) standards to manage versioning, with a pattern like: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

This implies that MAYOR versions might not be backwards compatible, MINOR versions may introduce new features keeping compatibility and PATCHes are for backwards compatible bug fixes.

This is the history of the main Puppet versions and some relevant changes
