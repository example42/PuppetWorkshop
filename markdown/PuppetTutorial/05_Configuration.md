# Operational modes

### Masterless - puppet apply

Your Puppet code (manifests) is applied directly on the target system.

No need of a complete infrastructure.

Have to distribute manifests and modules to the managed servers.

Command used: ```puppet apply``` (generally as root)

### Master / Client - puppet agent

You have clients, where Puppet client is installed and Masters where Puppet server resides

Client/Server communication is via https (**port 8140**)

Clients certificates have to be accepted (**signed**) on the Master

Command used on the client: ```puppet agent```  (generally as **root**)

Command used on the server: ```puppet master```  (generally as **puppet**)


# Masterless setup

  Puppet manifests are deployed directly on nodes and applied locally:

    puppet apply --modulepath /modules/ /manifest/file.pp

  More fine grained control on what goes in production for what nodes

  Ability to trigger multiple truly parallel Puppet runs

  No single point of failure, no Master performance issues

  Need to define a fitting deployment workflow. Hints: [Rump](https://github.com/railsmachine/rump) - [supply_drop](https://github.com/pitluga/supply_drop)

  With Puppet > 2.6 you can use file sources urls like:

    puppet:///modules/example42/apache/vhost.conf

    # they point to
    $modulepath/example42/apache/vhost.conf

  StoreConfigs usage requires a common Mysql (or Puppet DB) backend... Write permissions must be granted to all nodes


# Master / Client Setup

  A Puppet server (running as 'puppet') listening on 8140 on the PuppetMaster

  A Puppet client (running as 'root') on each managed node

  Client can be run as a service (default), via cron (with random delays), manually or via MCollective

  Client and Server have to share SSL certificates. New client certificates must be signed by the Master CA

  It's possible to enable automatic clients certificates signing on the Master (may involve security issues)

    # On puppet.conf [master]
    autosign = true # Default = false



# Certificates management

  On the Master you can use ```puppet cert``` to manage certificates

  List the (client) certificates to sign:

    puppet cert list

  List all certificates: signed (+), revoked (-), to sign ( ):

    puppet cert list --all

  Sign a client certificate:

    puppet cert sign <certname>

  Remove a client certificate:

    puppet cert clean <certname>

  Client stores its certificates and the server's public one in ```$vardir/ssl**``` (```/var/lib/puppet/ssl``` on Puppet OpenSource)

  Server stores clients public certificates and in ```$vardir/ssl/ca``` (```/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca```). DO NOT remove this directory.

# Certificates management - First run

By default the first Puppet run on a client fails:

    client # puppet agent -t
           # "Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled"

An optional ````--waitforcert 60``` parameter makes client wait 60 seconds before giving up.

The server has received the client's CSR which has to be manually signed:

    server # puppet cert sign <certname>

Once signed on the Master, the client can connect and receive its catalog:

    client # puppet agent -t


If you have issues with certificates (reinstalled client or other certs related problemes):

Be sure client and server times are synced

Clean up the client certificate. On the client remove it:

    client # mv /var/lib/puppet/ssl /var/lib/puppet/ssl.old

On the Master clean the old client certificate:

    server # puppet cert clean <certname>


# Puppet configuration: puppet.conf

It's Puppet main configuration file.
On opensource Puppet is generally in:

    /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

On Puppet Enterprise:

    /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

When running as a normal user can be placed in the home directory:

    /home/user/.puppet/puppet.conf

Configurations are divided in [stanzas] for different Puppet sub commands

Common for all commands: **[main]**

For puppet agent (client): **[agent]** (Was [puppetd] in Puppet pre 2.6)

For puppet apply (client): **[user]** (Was [puppet])

For puppet master (server): **[master]** (Was [puppetmasterd] and [puppetca])

Hash sign (#) can be used for comments.


# Main configuration options

To view all or a specific configuration setting:

    puppet config print all
    puppet config print modulepath

### Important options under **[main]** section:

  **vardir**: Path where Puppet stores dynamic data.

  **ssldir**: Path where SSL certifications are stored.

### Under **[agent]** section:

  **server**: Host name of the PuppetMaster. (Default: puppet)

  **certname**: Certificate name used by the client. (Default is its fqdn)

  **runinterval**: Number of minutes between Puppet runs, when running as service. (Default: 30)

  **report**: If to send Puppet runs' reports to the **report_server. (Default: true)

### Under **[master]** section:

  **autosign**: If new clients certificates are automatically signed. (Default: false)

  **reports**: How to manage clients' reports (Default: store)

  **storeconfigs**: If to enable store configs to support exported resources. (Default: false)

Full [configuration reference](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html)  on the official site.


# Common command-line parameters

All configuration options can be overriden by command-line options.

A very common option used when you want to see immediately the effect of a Puppet run (it's actually the combination of: --onetime, --verbose, --ignorecache, --no-daemonize, --no-usecacheonfailure, --detailed-exit-codes, --no-splay, and --show_diff):

    puppet agent --test # Can be abbreviate to -t

Run puppet agent in foreground and debug mode:

    puppet agent --test --debug

Run a dry-run puppet without making any change to the system:

    puppet agent --test --noop

Run puppet using an environment different from the default one:

    puppet agent --test --environment testing

Wait for certificate approval (by default 120 seconds) in the first Puppet run (useful during automated first fime installation if PuppetMaster's autosign is false):

    puppet agent --test --waitforcert 120


# Useful paths

**/var/log/puppet** contains logs (but also on normal syslog files, with facility daemon), both for agents and master

**/var/lib/puppet** contains Puppet operational data (catalog, certs, backup of files...)

**/var/lib/puppet/ssl**Â contains SSL certificate

**/var/lib/puppet/clientbucket** contains backup copies of the files changed by Puppet

**/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp** (On Master) The first manifest that the master parses when a client connects in order to produce the configuration to apply to it (Default on Puppet < 3.6 where are used **config-file environments**)

**/etc/puppet/environments/production/manifests/site.pp** (On Master) The first manifest that the master parses when using **directory environments** (recommended from Puppet 3.6 and default on Puppt >= 4)

**/etc/puppet/modules** and **/usr/share/puppet/modules** (On Master) The default directories where modules are searched

**/etc/puppet/environments/production/modules** (On Master) An extra place where modules are looked for when using **directory environments**
