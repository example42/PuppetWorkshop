# Resource references
In Puppet any resource is uniquely identified by its type and its name.
You can't have 2 resources of the same type with the same name in a catalog.

We have seen that you declare resources with a syntax like:

    type { 'name':
      arguments => values,
    }

When you need to reference to them in your code the syntax is like:

    Type['name']

Some examples:

    file { 'motd': ... }
    apache::virtualhost { 'example42.com': .... }
    exec { 'download_myapp': .... }

are referenced, respectively, with

    File['motd']
    Apache::Virtualhost['example42.com']
    Exec['download_myapp']


# Resource defaults
It's possible to set default argument values for a resource in order to reduce code dumplication. The syntax is:

    Type {
      argument => value,
    }

Common examples:

    Exec {
      path => '/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin',
    }

    File {
      mode  => 0644,
      owner => 'root',
      group => 'root',
    }

Resource defaults can be overriden when declaring a specific resource of the same type.

Note that the "Area of Effect" of resource defaults might bring unexpected results. The general suggestion is:

Place **global** resource defaults in /etc/pupept/manifests/site.pp outside any node definition.

Place **local** resource defaults at the beginning of a class that uses them (mostly for clarity sake, as they are parse-order independent).

# Nodes inheritance
On the PuppetMaster you can define with the **node** definition the resources to apply to any node.

It is possible to have an inheritance structure for nodes, so that resources defined for a node are automatically included in an inheriting node.

An example:

    node 'general' { ... }

    node 'www01' inherits general { ... }

In Puppet versions prior to 3, it was possibile to use nodes inheritance also to set variables and override them at different inheritance levels, and refer to these variables with their "short" name (not fully qualified).
When using this approach it was important to avoid the inclusion on classes in the inheritance tree, since some variables could be evaluated in an unexpected way.

This is no more possible because variables are not more dynamically scoped, and generally speaking nodes inheritance has been deprecated.

Just know that is exists and that if you still want to use it, be sure that you use it to include classes whose parameters are defined either on Hiera or at top scope.


# Class inheritance
In Puppet classes are just containers of resources and have nothing to do with OOP classes. Therefore the meaning of class inheritance is somehow limited to few specific cases.

When using class inheritance, the main class ('puppet' in the sample below) is always evaluated first and all the variables and resource defaults it sets are available in the scope of the child class ('puppet::server').

Moreover the child class can override the arguments of a resource defined in the main class. Note the syntax used when referring to the existing resource File['/etc/puppet/puppet.conf']:

    class puppet {
      file { '/etc/puppet/puppet.conf':
        content => template('puppet/client/puppet.conf'),
      }
    }

    class puppet::server inherits puppet {
      File['/etc/puppet/puppet.conf'] {
        content => template('puppet/server/puppet.conf'),
      }
    }


# Run Stages

In Puppet 2.6 it has been introduced the concept of Run Stages to help users in managing the order of dependencies when applying resources.

Puppet (> 2.6) provides a default **main** stage, you can add any number or further stages with the stage resource type:

    stage { 'pre':
      before => Stage['main'],
    }

Which is equivalent to:

    stage { 'pre': }
    Stage['pre'] -> Stage['main']

You can assign any class to a defined stage with the stage metaparameter:

    class { 'yum':
      stage => 'pre',
    }

Do not abuse of run stages (be vary of dependency cycles)!

[Official documentation on Run Stages](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_run_stages.html)

# Metaparameters
Metaparameters are parameters available to any resource type, they can be used for different purposes:

 Manage dependencies (**before**, **require**, **subscribe**, **notify**, **stage**)

 Manage resources' application policies (**audit**, **noop**, **schedule**, **loglevel**)

 Add information to a resource (**alias**, **tag**)

[Official documentation on Metaparameters](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/metaparameter.html)


# Managing dependencies
Puppet language is declarative and not procedural: it defines states, the order in which resources are written in manifests does not affect the order in which they are applied to the desired state.

To manage resources ordering, there are 3 different methods, which can cohexist:

  1 - Use the metaparameters **before**, **require**, **notify**, **subscribe**

  2 - Use the **Chaining arrows** (compared to the above metaparamers: **->** , **<-** , **<~** , **~>**)

  3 - Use run stages

# Managing dependencies

In a typical Package/Service/Configuration file example you want the package to be installed first, configure it and then start the service, eventually managing its restart if the config file changes.

This can be expressed with metaparameters:

    package { 'exim':
      before => File['exim.conf'],  
    }

    file { 'exim.conf':
      notify => Service['exim'],
    }

    service { 'exim':
    }

which is equivalent to

    Package['exim'] -> File['exim.conf'] ~> Service['exim']

But the same ordering can be expressed using the alternative reverse metaparameters:

    package { 'exim':
    }

    file { 'exim.conf':
      require => Package['exim'],
    }

    service { 'exim':
      subscribe => File['exim.conf'],
    }

which can also be expressed like:

    Service['exim'] <~ File['exim.conf'] <- Package['exim']


# Conditionals
Puppet provides different constructs to manage conditionals inside manifests:

**Selectors** allows to set the value of a variable or an argument inside a resource declaration according to the value of another variable.
Selectors therefore just returns values and are not used to manage conditionally entire blocks of code.

**case statements** are used to execute different blocks of code according to the values of a variable. It's possible to have a default block for unmatched entries.
Case statements are NOT used inside resource declarations.

**if elsif else** conditionals, like case, are used to execute different blocks of code and can't be used inside resources declarations.
You can can use any of Puppet's comparison expressions and you can combine more than one for complex patterns matching.

**unless** is somehow the opposite of **if**. It evaluates a boolean condition and if it's *false* it executes a block of code. It doesn't have elsif / else clauses.

# Sample: Assign a variable value

#### Selector for variable's assignement

     $package_name = $osfamily ? {
       'RedHat' => 'httpd',
       'Debian' => 'apache2',
       default  => undef,
     }

#### case

     case $::osfamily {
       'Debian': { $package_name = 'apache2' }
       'RedHat': { $package_name = 'httpd' }
       default: { notify { "Operating system $::operatingsystem not supported" } }
     }

#### if elsif else

     if $::osfamily == 'Debian' {       $package_name = 'apache2'
     } elsif $::osfamily == 'RedHat' {       $package_name = 'httpd'
     } else {       notify { "Operating system $::operatingsystem not supported" }     }

# Comparing strings

#### Comparison operators
Puppet supports some common comparison operators: ```==  !=   <  >  <=  >=  =~  !~``` and the somehow less common ```in```

     if $::osfamily == 'Debian' { [ ... ] }

     if $::kernel != 'Linux' { [ ... ] }

     if $::uptime_days > 365 { [ ... ] }

     if $::operatingsystemrelease <= 6 { [ ... ] }


#### in operator
The in operator checks if a string present in another string, an array or in the keys of an hash

     if '64' in $::architecture

     if $monitor_tool in [ 'nagios' , 'icinga' , 'sensu' ]

#### Expressions combinations
It's possible to combine multiple comparisons with **and** and **or**

    if ($::osfamily == 'RedHat') and ($::operatingsystemrelease == '5') { [ ... ] }

    if (operatingsystem == 'Ubuntu') or ($::operatingsystem == 'Mint') { [ ...] }

# Exported resources

When you need to provide to an host informations about resources present in another host, you need **exported resources**: resources declared in the catalog of a node (based on its facts and variables) but applied (collected) on another node.

Resources are declared with the special @@ notation which marks them as exported so that they are not applied to the node where they are declared:

    @@host { $::fqdn:
      ip  => $::ipaddress,
    }

    @@concat::fragment { "balance-fe-${::hostname}",
      target  => '/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg',
      content => "server ${::hostname} ${::ipaddress} maxconn 5000"
      tag     => "balance-fe",
    }

Once a catalog containing exported resources has been applied on a node and stored by the PuppetMaster (typically on PuppetDB), the exported resources can be collected with the spaceshift syntax (where is possible to specify search queries):

    Host << || >>
    Concat::Fragment <<| tag == "balance-fe" |>>
    Sshkey <<| |>>
    Nagios_service <<||>>

# Exported resources - Configuration

In order to use exported resources you need to enable on the Puppet Master the **storeconfigs** option and specify the backend to use.
You can do this configure a PuppetMaster to use PuppetDB:

    storeconfigs = true
    storeconfigs_backend = puppetdb

In earlier Puppet versions storeconfigs is based on ActiveRecord, which is considerable slower.
