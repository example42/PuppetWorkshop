# Reporting

  In reports Puppet stores information of what has changed on the system after a Puppet run

  Reports are sent from the client to the Master, if report is enabled

    # On client's puppet.conf [agent]
    report = true

  On the Master different report processors may be enabled

    # On server's puppet.conf [master]
    reports = log,tagmail,store,https
    reporturl = http://localhost:3000/reports

# Understanding Puppet runs output

  Puppet is very informative about what it does on the functions
